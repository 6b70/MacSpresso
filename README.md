## About MacSpresso
MacSpresso is a simple menu bar app that keeps your Mac awake, allowing long-running processes to finish up without interruption.

MacSpresso lives and dies in your menu bar. When the mug is visible, caffeination is active. Otherwise the app is closed to prevent menu bar clutter.
